      <p class="dark:text-white">
        Develop my communication, interpersonal, and public speaking skills which will form the basis for my mediation, arbitration, and litigation. This I believe will help me achieve success in my future. By actively networking with legal professionals, and mentors I would like to gain experience in legal research, and writing and broaden my understanding of the legal profession. I also want to improve my analytical thinking skills and learn to adapt quickly as law is an ever-evolving profession. The fact that the law changes so swiftly amazes me, I consider myself passionate about learning. Ultimately, I want to maintain a strong academic record throughout my law school journey.
